A React-based photo gallery app built with the Unsplash API.
Browse popular photos, search by keyword, view your search history, and open photos in full view with detailed stats.

üì∏ Features
Home Page: Displays the 20 most popular photos
Search: Text input updates results automatically (no search button)
Caching: Previously searched keywords are cached to avoid redundant API requests
History Page: Lists all searched keywords; clicking on one reloads cached results
Infinite Scroll: Loads more images dynamically on scroll (both pages)
Modal View: Clicking a photo opens a modal with full-size image, likes, views, and downloads
